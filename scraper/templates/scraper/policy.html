<div class="main_content">
	<p>Usage of our site including all of its contents is free of charge for anyone for personal usage. Organisations can use this site but we would be happy if you do contact and clear it with us first. Permission for organisations/companies is not needed for obvious "well meaning" usage, i.e. distributing works of cultural benefit for the end user.</p>
	<p>Extensive usage of this site (webscrappers, scripts, bots etc) isn't appreciated yet because we're running this site privately. But if you want large amount of data from our website then do contact us we would be happy to help.</p>
	<p>The site is running privately. That means that we do not guarantee that the site will be available for users at all time but we try our best to make the site run stable.</p>
	<p>It's completely the user's responsibility to use this site rightly. We do not censor but we do block people that use our service wrongfully.</p>
	<p>This policy may change at any time. Please have a close eye on it.
